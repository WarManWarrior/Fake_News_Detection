# Fake News Detection Using Bayesian Decision Theory

This repository contains code and data for detecting fake news articles using Bayesian Decision Theory. The project leverages probabilistic models to classify news articles as genuine or fake, providing a robust approach to misinformation detection.

## Project Structure

- `DATA_KAGGLE/`: Directory containing datasets sourced from Kaggle, used for training and testing the models.
- `news_data/`: Folder with additional news data samples for analysis.
- `BayesianModel.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook implementing the initial Bayesian model for fake news detection.
- `Bayesian_Model2.ipynb`: Enhanced version of the Bayesian model with improved features and performance.

## Getting Started

To explore and run the code:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Skc2004/Fake-News-Detection_Using_Bayesian_Descision_Theory.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Fake-News-Detection_Using_Bayesian_Descision_Theory
   ```

3. **Install required dependencies**: Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook and necessary Python libraries installed.
4. **Open the notebooks**: Use Jupyter Notebook to open and run `BayesianModel.ipynb` and `Bayesian_Model2.ipynb` to understand and experiment with the models.

## Data

The datasets used in this project are located in the `DATA_KAGGLE` and `news_data` directories. These datasets are essential for training and evaluating the Bayesian models.
